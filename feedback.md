# Technical Requirements

Performing - Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.

# Creativity and Interface	

Performing -The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

Love how you added additional JavaScript to make the interface more interactive. Also love the color scheme!

# Code Quality

Performing - Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues.

Looks great, I would just make sure to indent everything fully.

# Functionality

Performing - Application contains no major errors	

# Planning / Process / Submission	

Progressing - App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality.

Make sure to write a full readme and add planning documents to your project submissions.

Great job on this project!
